EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

This Solidity smart contract implements a basic lending and borrowing system using OpenZeppelin libraries for safety and simplicity. 

Libraries that i used are IERC20 and SafeERC20, for safe token transfers and ERC20 for compatibility and Ownable that allows contract ownership control (only the owner can perform admin actions). 

Key Components are as follows
collateralToken and loanToken: ERC20 tokens used for depositing and borrowing.
collateralFactor: Defines the over-collateralization ratio (e.g., 150% means you must deposit 1.5x the loan amount).
collateral and debt mappings: Track how much collateral a user has deposited and how much they owe. 

Functions used in the ocde
depositCollateral(uint256 amount) - User deposits collateral tokens into the contract. These tokens are stored and increase their collateral balance.
borrow(uint256 amount) - Allows user to borrow loan tokens up to the allowed limit based on their deposited collateral. Checks ensure sufficient collateralization. 
repay(uint256 amount) - The borrower repays their debt by transferring loan tokens back to the contract.
withdrawCollateral(uint256 amount) - Let users withdraw their collateral only if they have no remaining debt.
