# SimpleStorage Frontend

Small frontend for the SimpleStorage smart contract. I updated the UI to a modern layout with a header, sidebar, responsive cards, and a dark/light theme toggle. The original blockchain read/write logic (using ethers.js) is preserved.

Quick start

- Install dependencies:

	npm install

- Run dev server:

	npm run dev

Open http://localhost:5173 and connect a Web3 wallet (e.g. MetaMask) to interact with the contract.
