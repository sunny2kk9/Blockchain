# GetterSetter Smart Contract 💻

This project demonstrates a simple **Getter-Setter Smart Contract** built using **Hardhat** and integrated with a **frontend interface** for seamless blockchain interaction.  
It allows users to set and retrieve stored values on the blockchain network.

## 📁 Project Structure

### **artifacts/**
Contains compiled contract files and metadata automatically generated by Hardhat after compilation.

### **cache/**
Stores temporary build and compilation data to speed up subsequent compilations.

### **contracts/**
Holds all Solidity smart contract files.  
For this project, it includes the main `GetterSetter.sol` contract.

### **frontend/**
Contains the frontend application code used to interact with the deployed smart contract.  
Built using modern web tools for connecting to blockchain via MetaMask or similar wallets.

### **ignition/**
Used for Hardhat Ignition deployment configurations and modules.

### **node_modules/**
Includes all installed dependencies and packages required for Hardhat and the frontend environment.

### **scripts/**
Houses JavaScript files used for deploying and managing contracts on various networks.

### **test/**
Contains test scripts to verify that the smart contract behaves as expected under different scenarios.

### **.env**
Stores sensitive environment variables like API keys, private keys, and network details.  
(Not shared publicly for security reasons.)

### **.gitignore**
Specifies which files and folders should be ignored by Git (e.g., node_modules, .env, build artifacts).

### **hardhat.config.js**
The main configuration file for Hardhat — defines networks, compiler settings, and plugins.

### **package.json & package-lock.json**
Contain project dependencies, scripts, and metadata for both Hardhat and the frontend.

### **README.md**
Documentation file (this one) describing the purpose, structure, and deployment details of the project.
